# Display

The car showroom for which you wrote software in the "Cars" project was so impressed with your work that they now asked you create a GUI. They would like to run the simulations with different parameters to interactively see the results. For this, your GUI should accept the number of agents and customers as inputs and display the results of the simulation. To guide you, their designer has come up with a mockup that you will find in the gui/ folder.
